Hello! My name is Casey McQuillan, and I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Economics Department at Princeton University. My research interests are in public finance, labor economics, and applied microeconomics. I will be on the 2025-2026 academic job market. 

Currently, my research agenda focuses on unemployment insurance and take-up. I investigate policy-relevant questions such as whether more generous benefits induce more workers to claim benefits, how benefit receipt improves job search and re-employment for low-income workers, and if targeted outreach can increase program participation. My previous work examines how employer-sponsored health insurance and rising premiums have contributed to labor market inequality.

Before beginning my Ph.D. at Princeton, I worked as a Senior Research Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. I graduated from Amherst College in 2018 with a B.A. in Economics and Mathematics.
