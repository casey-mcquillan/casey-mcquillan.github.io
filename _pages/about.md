Hello! My name is Casey McQuillan, and I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Economics Department at Princeton University. My research interests are public finance, labor economics, and applied microeconomics. I will be on the 2025-2026 academic job market. 

Currently, my research agenda focuses on unemployment insurance and how to use causal inference to answer policy relevant questions, such as whether more generous benefits induce more workers to take up, how benefit receipt facilitates better job matches for low-income workers at the eligibility threshold, and if targeted outreach can improve take-up. Previous work includes quantifying how much employer-sponsored health insurance and rising premiums have contributed to labor market inequality.
