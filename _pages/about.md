Hello! My name is Casey McQuillan, and I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Economics Department at Princeton University. My research interests are labor economics, public finance, and causal inference. 

Currently, my research agenda focuses on unemployment insurance and how to use causal inference to answer policy relevant questions, such as whether benefit generosity induces greater take-up, how benefit receipt facilitates better job matches for workers at the eligibility threshold, and if targeted information interventions improve take-up for low-income workers. Previous work includes quantifying how much employer-sponsored health insurance and rising premiums have contributed to labor market inequality. 

My email is caseycm@princeton.edu.
