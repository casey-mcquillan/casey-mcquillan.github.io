## Incomplete and Endogenous Take-Up of Unemployment Insurance Benefits
(with Brendan Moore)
> This paper examines the incomplete and endogenous take-up of unemployment insurance (UI) benefits as well as its policy implications. Standard models of UI focus on how benefit generosity affects the average claim duration, assuming perfect take-up. Yet, benefit receipt is highly incomplete, with estimates of take-up among eligible workers below 50 percent in the United States. We show that take-up is an important margin of response: If benefits become more generous, more workers claim benefits in addition to claimants remaining on benefits for longer. Using a sample of likely eligible workers, we leverage a regression kink design to identify the causal effect of weekly benefit level on take-up and total benefit duration. Our results suggest a 10 percent increase in the weekly benefit leads to a 4.8 percent increase in take-up, which drives a 6.4 percent increase in total benefit duration. Previous work did not account for a take-up response and thus underestimated the fiscal externality associated with raising benefit levels. Endogenous take-up has implications for UI policy: the wedge between the optimal benefit level and full insurance doubles; the value of spending to raise the benefit level decreases by 20 cents for every \$1.

## The Benefits of Unemployment Insurance for Marginally Attached Workers
> Existing research documents that more generous unemployment insurance (UI) delays job finding with limited effects on job quality. This paper exploits the eligibility threshold to examine how UI receipt impacts job search for lower-income workers. Using employer-employee matched data from Washington State and a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, we find that UI receipt minimally delays re-employment but substantially improves labor market outcomes. UI increases cumulative hours worked by approximately 15 full-time weeks and earnings by \$14,000 in the two years following job loss, representing 37 percent and 50 percent increases, respectively. These gains are driven by improved job quality, as recipients experience longer tenure and higher wages with their next employer. Effects are larger for workers living near public employment offices, suggesting that access to re-employment services enhances search productivity. Expanding UI access by lowering the eligibility threshold is much more cost-effective than raising benefit levels or extending potential duration, as workers benefit from more stable, higher-paying re-employment that partially offsets its cost.
