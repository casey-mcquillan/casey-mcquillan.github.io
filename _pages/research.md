## Incomplete and Endogenous Take-Up of Unemployment Insurance Benefits

> This paper examines the incomplete and endogenous take-up of unemployment insurance (UI) benefits as well as its policy implications. Standard models of UI focus on how benefit generosity affects the average claim duration, assuming perfect take-up. Yet, benefit receipt is highly incomplete, with estimates of take-up among eligible workers below 50 percent in the United States. We show that take-up is an important margin of response: If benefits become more generous, more workers claim benefits in addition to claimants remaining on benefits for longer. Using a sample of likely eligible workers, we leverage a regression kink design to identify the causal effect of weekly benefit level on take-up and total benefit duration. Our results suggest a 10 percent increase in the weekly benefit leads to a 4.8 percent increase in take-up, which drives a 6.4 percent increase in total benefit duration. Previous work did not account for a take-up response and thus underestimated the fiscal externality associated with raising benefit levels. Endogenous take-up has implications for UI policy: the wedge between the optimal benefit level and full insurance doubles; the value of spending to raise the benefit level decreases by 20 cents for every \$1.
